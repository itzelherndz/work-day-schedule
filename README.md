As seen on the above figure, the time blocks that are in the past are shaded in gray, the time block that is in the present is shaded in red, and the time blocks that are in the future are shaded in green.

When the user clicks on an text area, the user can fill it out with the event(s) of the corresponding time. The event will not be saved unless the user clicks the corresponding save button. Once saved the data will be stored in local storage. If the user decides to refresh the page, the data will still be there. This is demonstrated in the following figure.
